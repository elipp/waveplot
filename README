waveplawt:

An OpenGL wav file waveform plotting program using smoothed line segments and indexed VBOs. 

req 

Windows: OpenGL >= 3.3 support is required (glVertexAttribPointer, shaders use GLSL 330)
	- however, the program still uses the OpenGL matrix stack deprecated by the 3.0 spec,
	  which is why the windows shaders shall be rewritten to 140 or 150 in the near future.

Linux:
	Only OpenGL <=1.4 calls are used, because the graphics adapter on my netbook (intel i915) 
	only supports OpenGL up to version 1.4, where generic vertex attributes (glVertexAttribPointer)
	aren't supported. Also requires libsdl.

A test input file is provided, name asdfmono.wav.
