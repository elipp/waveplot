waveplot: 
	OpenGL .wav file waveform monitor for OpenGL 2.0+ compatible devices.
	No deprecated OpenGL functionality is used (i.e. no matrix stack or fixed-function rendering calls). 
	The shaders use GLSL 330.
	
	Features:
		- a highly tuned collection of linear algebra-related functions
		  using MSVC intrinsics (up to SSE4: DPPS)
		- "inertial" mouse navigation, heads-up display
	
	Currently, only the Windows version compiles and works.
